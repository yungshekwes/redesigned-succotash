            Flaw 5: XSS vulnerability due to the use of the safe tag in rendering, and also the 
            fact that logged in users can access other user's accounts.
            Fix: Remove the safe tag in the html file, and implement a checking mechanism to ensure that the Customer_id
            is the same as that of the session, so that a logged in user cannot access someone else' account.
